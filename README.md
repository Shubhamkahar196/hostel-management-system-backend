## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

-   Node.js (v14 or higher)
-   MySQL Server

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Vermadeepakd1/hostel-management-system-backend.git](https://github.com/Vermadeepakd1/hostel-management-system-backend.git)
    cd hostel-management-system-backend
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add the following environment variables. Replace the values with your local database credentials.

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    DB_NAME=hostel_system
    DB_PORT=3306
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    ```

4.  **Set up the database:**
    -   Create a new MySQL database named `hostel_system`.
    -   Run the SQL queries found in the `database_schema.sql` file (or run them one by one) to create the necessary tables (`admins`, `students`, `rooms`, `fees`, `complaints`).

5.  **Start the server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start running at `http://localhost:5000`.
